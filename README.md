🛫 Exciting News! 📊✈️

I'm thrilled to share my latest project – a simple airline dashboard created using Power BI, showcasing valuable insights from an extensive airline dataset. 📈✨

🔍 Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in the dashboard:

1️⃣ Total Flights based on Flight Status: An overview of on-time and delayed flights, helping airlines to manage their schedules effectively.

2️⃣ Total Flights based on Age Group: Understanding the demographics of passengers, facilitating targeted marketing efforts.

3️⃣ Total Flights per Continent: Exploring global travel trends and making data-driven decisions for route planning.

4️⃣ Top 5 Countries with Delayed Flights: Identifying the areas where improvements are needed for smoother operations.

5️⃣ Top 5 Nationalities with Delayed Flights: Insights to enhance customer experience and satisfaction.

6️⃣ Total Flights per Gender: Tailoring services based on the preferences of male and female passengers.

Data-driven decisions are the future of the aviation industry, and this dashboard is a step in that direction. ✈️💼
